# Team Fortress 2 - Who can use chat?
### This is the final project for eecs 398 - practical data science

## Introduction
The game Team Fortress 2 (TF2), developed by Valve is an old and loved game that has been plagued by a botting problem. Some people might be familiar
with a viral online campaign to get Valve's attention in addressing the problem in recent years, but the plague has been around for at least a
decade. Some years ago, Valve disabled all chat communication for Free-To-Play (F2P) players in an effort to combat the abuse of the chat by botters.
This is a controversial feature that does clamp down on the chat abuse somewhat, but limits the game significantly for f2p players, like preventing
them from calling for `MEDIC!` when they are low on health. In a recent update, Valve began granting chat permissions to *some* f2p players, but
did not disclose the requirements, probably for good reason to discourage botters from finding a loophole. The youtuber Shounic put out a survey
to collect data on communications access and see if there were any factors that may point towards chat privileges. The [dataset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATzcWmuPfsA&t=1s) used in this project is the survey results published by Shounic.

### The million dollar question: What account characteristics determine whether or not a TF2 player can use chat after the update?

This question is important because examining Valve's metrics will give insight into what they believe distinguishes a bot from a real player. Botting isn't a problem unique to TF2, and verifying that somebody is a real person is becoming a more and more relevant problem in today's world, with the prevalence of AI.
Instead of using a CAPTCHA or any singular metric, modern tools will have to look at a variety of metrics and signals to determine if somebody is "real".


### The dataset has **12** columns and **3587** rows, corresponding to 3587 survey responses. Some important columns are:

`what do you have permission to do after the update?`
- Contains 4 unique strings, corresponding to levels of chat permissions: *text chat, no voice commands*, *no text chat, voice commands*, *text chat, voice commands*, *no text chat, no voice commands*
- This column will be the dependent variable that I will attempt to predict in this project

**Promising Features**

`how old is your steam account?`
- Contains a string in the format of *number* + *years old*, representing an integer number of years old a respondee's steam account is. (Steam is the platform that tf2 is on)

`how many hours do you have in tf2`
- Integer number of hours respondee has on tf2

`have you spent money on this steam account?`
- String that is "Yes" or "No" corresponding to if respondee has spent money on their steam account

`do you have a verified email on the account?`
- String that is "Yes" or "No" corresponding to respondee's verified email status

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Cleaning Steps
1. **Hours played**: Removed extreme outliers (>20,000 hours) and the entire row for those entries (since those are just people messing with the survey)
2. **Account age**: Converted text values to numeric years (e.g., "6 years old" â†’ 6.0)
3. **Target variable**: Created binary classification

### Key Findings
- Most players surveyed have some form of communication access
- Free-to-play status appears is strongly correlated to communication restrictions
- Players with communication restrictions tend to have fewer hours played
