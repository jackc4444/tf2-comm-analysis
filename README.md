# Team Fortress 2 - Who can use chat?
### This is the final project for eecs 398 - practical data science

## Introduction
The game Team Fortress 2 (TF2), developed by Valve is an old and loved game that has been plagued by a botting problem. Some people might be familiar
with a viral online campaign to get Valve's attention in addressing the problem in recent years, but the plague has been around for at least a
decade. Some years ago, Valve disabled all chat communication for Free-To-Play (F2P) players in an effort to combat the abuse of the chat by botters.
This is a controversial feature that does clamp down on the chat abuse somewhat, but limits the game significantly for f2p players, like preventing
them from calling for `MEDIC!` when they are low on health. In a recent update, Valve began granting chat permissions to *some* f2p players, but
did not disclose the requirements, probably for good reason to discourage botters from finding a loophole. The youtuber Shounic put out a survey
to collect data on communications access and see if there were any factors that may point towards chat privileges. The [dataset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATzcWmuPfsA&t=1s) used in this project is the survey results published by Shounic.
